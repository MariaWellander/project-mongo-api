# Project Mongo API

This is Maria Wellander's second backend project.
I've created a RESTful avocado sales API in Node.js with the Express framework, Mongoose library and a database from MongoDB.

## The problem

To solve the problem I made a good plan. The fundamentals for me was to not overcomplicate the solution by adding features that wasn't needed in the project description - that I could add in the end if I had some spare time and extra coding energy. Focus was to make something that worked and that I could understand. I didn't want to lack time, be stressed and don't understand what I'd built. Therefore, I chose a JSON consisting of sales data. Loving avocados, having a background in business and adoring numbers, I knew that data could give me the safe and secure project start that is so much appreciated.

Firstly, I planned on getting a good understanding of the project goals and achieve a decent result by; reading and watching all the material and taking part in all the activities for the week. During the building of the project, if I got stuck I wanted to really take the time to understand by re-read and re-watch the material. Secondly, I made a Google Jamboard with a Kanban board to structure up my project and my plans. Finally, I planned on code along to the lectures to have a base and then to modify the code during off-lecture-time and to add the features that I needed.

For this backend project I used; JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Postman, nodemon, Google Cloud, REST API, JSON, Google Jamboard & Kanban board.

If I had more time I would've enjoyed building a frontend to it.
